1. Tool and Language: Selenium , Serenity , BDD framework , JAVA, Gradle
2. Why BDD (Behaviour Driven Development)
        -> it uses simple english language to write testcase so any non technical person can also add test
        -> it has a behaviour based testcase which helps in recognising all the issue for registration form or any kind of testing
        -> it is easy to maintain
        -> Clarity. Scenarios focus on the expected behaviors of the product
        -> Writing scenarios from the beginning enforces quality-first and test-first mindsets
3. Why Selenium
        -> It is an open source and have a lot of testing coverage
        -> It has provision to add libraries and use a lot of different testing skills(Skuli, Apache, ETC)

4. Why Gradle
        -> It is faster build management tool than maven
        -> It has less complicated config files
        -> It provides high performance and scalable builds
        -> Gradle integration process is quite easier

5. Why Serenity
        -> It has a very organised set of config and management files
        -> It has it's own reporting format inbuilt
        -> You can use the tool along with JUnit to quickly write clean and maintainable acceptable criteria or integrate it with WebDriver to test web applications in Selenium

6. Automation Plan
        -> Cover all the scenarios in BDD framework according to the requirements
        -> For Captcha: a. By disabling the Captcha in the testing environment
                        b. Adding a hook to click the Captcha checkbox
                        c. By adding a delay to the Webdriver and manually solve Captcha while testing
